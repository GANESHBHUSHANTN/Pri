  <title>Pri, you have been my first crush, first love and first attention to a girl with whom I would like to laugh, talk and kiss with.
    And you'll be the second last for sure, I hope you know who's along with you. 
    And let this effort of mine be a tiny memorable footnote for us, as we are stepping into the 23rd New year of our lives.
    And with the most purest form of love I am feeling and will be feeling forever...
    This one is for You my ❤️</title>

    <ul>
      <li>You make me feel what I am, when I listen to you, talk to you and feel about you...</li>
      <li>The way when you call me'Chuchundhar', this makes me feel tooooooooooo shy and also anger. Balki mai himsa ka against hu and also I carry my ego (todha sa quantity) when I am with people, but tumhare liye toh these things won't work at all</li>
      <li>You feel like my mom, getting cared, eager to talk, feeling about each other and most importantly, getting motivated and wished by you is a divine thing to me.</li>
      <li>You are my favorite thought, either it is of love, friendship, entrepreneurial things, bakchodi LUST (most important), motivated societal talks and about US</li>
      <li>I make you feel bore, and I sense it, future mai bhi aisa hoga, but I genuinely know that it will remain for just few moments as I will be there to make you feel the rest of moments like a 'baby', bcoz you're my BABY!</li>
      <li>I don't have any other option too!, aur time bhi nahi hai kisi dusri ladki ko pataane (JK). I just need you baby</li>

    Every smile, every call, every silence with you
    is something I hold close.
    And Pri, let these memories (at an initial phase), stay with you, me and US
  </p>
</section>
    <p>
      The convo which we do it, has a severe impact to know about you and feel too...
      is something I hold too close that I feel that these are my traits.
      Your likes, hates, loves and disappointments have the reason which you align, but are also my terminus pros to neutralize to make you feel warm.
      The gifts which u have given and that u will give, are of devout serenity to carry into my heart, waping through my tears within the cute texts which u enclosed along with them. The innumberable kisses which I have kissed to the ring and seeing your only single photo made me feel a lunatic saint who's worshipping for his messaiah without being relentlessly restless.

  <!-- SECTION 5: LOVE LETTER -->
  <section class="letter">
    <h2>From My Heart 💌</h2>
    <textarea placeholder= It started from the day when I started to think about you, throug your voice notes and minimalistic conversations which we had. I thought that you are one such a girl with whom I conversed as a stranger. But a strange feel of befriending yoour voice notes and a single photo of yours made me feel fantasized to think about you. I thought it to be a delulu, infatuation or a subtle interest. But I found it to be a love, a purest form of interpreting the purpose of existence for another person, with a purpose to live and without any purpose to question that why to live.
    Let me get romantic @ this spot. I wanna kiss you like anything as a person who is craving for the dosage of blossom of love from a purest form, through reciprocated heart beat, in sync through a tight hug and getting wet (chill, utna bhi dark nahi hu! Imagine that rain is happening and if u are not okay, then wahi samajhlo)
    I am seeing my rest of the life with you, playing, smiling, quarreling (you will win in all the cases!), sleeping, hugging and binge watching your favourite webseries through an OTT stuff @ Home Theater, and many tonnes of things too. Also, I acknowledge and see a couple of hurdles too at the initial stage.
    But, I promise you (documented) that I will surely cross those barriers, clear them to allow the path for you, enabling my girl to enter into my life.
    
    You remember the tea-jug and cups analogy, right? Abhi pooch raha hu, with your consent and love...
    
    Will you be the Tea for me and my kids...?. And the reason why am I asking this to you is...
    
    
    I LOVE YOU PRIYANKA. I AM FUCKINGLY IN NEED OF YOU, as I cannot see a greater woman than you with me, in my life.
    Tumhare saath mai life-long rahunga, and these are not to bluff. And practically tum mere saath apne life long nahi reh paogi kyuki tum mujhse jaldi mar sakti ho, Chances are there as you're 6 months older than me.
    A dark joke within the romantic stuff...
    But I would also accompany, irritate and torture you when u are going to hell (ham dono ke dark minds se toh surely swarg nahi jaayenge)
    And there are fantasies too, aage padhlo chuchundhar. Bas ek hi sentence bolunga, I WANNA MARRY and LIVE WITH YOU PRIYANKA!></textarea>
